### What I learned

I'm an angular developer with 4 year experience, and yet I've never actually written a site with just HTML and CSS. It's always been around js frameworks and CSS frameworks. It was a fun challenge because I found myself googling simple basic things like "How to center a div".

One of the biggest challenges I ran into was structuring my CSS classes in a way that didn't repeat, was reusable, and was clean. Starting by building just the HTML and adding CSS afterwards and cleaning as I went helped.
